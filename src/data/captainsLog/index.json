By request, I've revived the change log. I'm going to take a more structuredâ€“dare I say professionalâ€“approach to writing it.\n\nRecently, I posted again to Reddit, and the overwhelming feedback received was that I switch to using an OAuth model where users can authenticate with Bungie. The primary reason for this request, being asked to select your character on each subsequent visit, can be solved without OAuth. Other indirect requests for OAuth include the ability to see ones currencies and other class specific items on the Vendors page. I have failed to explain to users that the Vendors endpoint actually requires OAuth, and when they view them on Braytech, they're actually viewing them from the perspective of my own character (Warlock).\n\nWhile I have reached a level of skill where I could dare to try integrating OAuth, it's not without its cons i.e. quickly and easily looking up another player. You could argue that I could integrate it side by side with my current lookup mechanism... But I don't want to.\n\nLeading up to Christmas, I had completely lost myself in working on this site. It's easy to lose perspective as you bury yourself in feature after feature, especially of your over-arching goal.\n\nI'm not trying to build a DIM competitor or replace similar sites. Braytech is a learning exercise and something that I too want to enjoy using. A convenient and semi-beautiful tool to aid in my Destiny obsession.\n\nIt started as a Xur location/sales tracker. Then I took on some checklists. And now... Well it's a bit of everything, now...\n        "

    "content": "\n## Changes\n- Added NotificationApp component\n- Changed index.js into AppEntry component in order to handle callbacks from ServiceWorker to notify the aforementioned of a pending update\n- Amended some minor styles\n- Fixed an ObservedImage component bug\n- Removed index.css because it literally did nothing\n\n## Conversation\nThe long-awaited update notification has finally landed. It's been a long time coming because I've never used ServiceWorkers before. I keep typing ServiceWalkers instead of ServiceWorkers which I find super strange.\n\nAnyway, the basic ideaâ€“as far as I understand itâ€“behind ServiceWorkers is that they run behind the code that actually drives Braytech or other sites and apps. They silently perform tasks in the background like checking for new code. When they find new code, they tell the browser, and the next time the users visitsâ€“after closing all tabs of the siteâ€“the browser installs and runs the new code.\n\nLots of fun capabilities come with ServiceWorkers, like making web apps feel more like offline native apps. The reason I use them is for how effectively they cache frequently used assets. Subsequent visits to Braytech load instantly. We all like this.\n"

A better version of the font. Fonts matter a lot to me. The medium weight on this one is a bit thick but we'll see how she fares.\n\nI've made a mess of the Account viewâ€“previously the Overview viewâ€“and I'm looking for a better purpose to assign it. Perhaps basics data about your characters, such as time played, subclasses unlocked, whether they've completed storylines, etc."

    "content": "## Changes\n- Removed link to Vendors page. Read about it below.\n- Made inline nav improvements for smaller viewports\n- Added 'rare collectibles' to Account view\n\n## Conversation\nSo, why the heck did you remove the Vendors page!\n- it was a reflection of my personal vendor data meaning my Destiny progression affects what it displays. Normally, Vendors are hidden behind OAuthâ€“the funky click to login with Bungie buttonsâ€“which Braytech doesnâ€™t use. More on this in a tick\n- only a small fraction of users actually used it\n\nSo, why doesnâ€™t Braytech use OAuth then? A few reasons. \n- Iâ€™ve always wanted Braytech to be as accessible as possible. Requiring users to authenticate hampers that. OAuth is required for things like inventory actions. That market is very well-filled by DIM, Ishtar Commander, and at least 5 other apps\n- itâ€™d be a fair bit of work to implement and as Braytech is a hobby and hobbies are meant to be fun...\n- why donâ€™t you just have both options?\n\nThe good news? I haven't nuked the page entirely. You can still access it at braytech.org/vendors.\n\nThe final change in this minor update is an improvement to the Account view. I've added 'rare collectibles' allowing you to see, at a glance, if a player is good or not. A joke. I'll be adding more modules over time, as I think of them."
